    <h1 class="top" style="width: 50%;"> The History of Kievan Rus' </h1>
    <h3 class="top" style="color: #faf2e4; width: 50%;"> According to Britannica (n.d.), Kievan Rus’ is the first eastern Slavic state. It was founded by the Viking Oleg, ruler of the northern city of Novgorod from 879, who seized Smolensk and Kiev, the latter of which became the capital. Rus’ golden age was during the 10th and 11th centuries under Vladimir I and Yaroslav. It became a political and cultural center due to its influence. When Yaroslav died in 1054, 35 years since he first ruled, his sons divided the empire into factions at war. During the 13th century, the Mongol conquest ended the power of Rus’. Some sections of the western territory are now currently part of Poland and Lithuania. </h3>

    <h2 style="width: 90%; color: #fdb750;">The Rise and Fall of Rus'</h2>
    <h5 style="width: 90%"> According to Britannica (n.d.), the story begins with the Viking leader Oleg, who became the prince of Kiev and the founder of the state of Rus’. After succeeding his kinsman as the ruler of Novgorod, he went down the Dnieper River (the fourth longest river in Europe) with his team of Scandinavian voyagers. He seized control of Smolensk and Kiev then extended his power to the east and west of the Volkhov–Dnieper waterway. Due to this, he became the undisputed ruler of the Kievan–Novgorodian state. Kievan Rus’ reached its peak in the 10th and 11th centuries, but of course, many civilizations in the past met their end. Yaroslav was one of Vladimir’s children. He became prince after killing his brother, who beforehand killed three of their other brothers to seize power. To end the bloodshed that might arise again, similar to what happened to his siblings, Yaroslav introduced an order of succession through seniority for his children. Contrary to his goals, this did not work, since after his death his sons divided the empire into warring factions. The story of Rus’ ends after its power was ended by the Mongol conquest. </h5>

      <h4 style="text-align: center; color: #b7e9f7;"> Rurik </h4>
      <h6> Rurik was a Viking prince whose story is told in the Russian Primary Chronicle. According to it, which is not fully accepted as canon, he was invited by Novgorod citizens to govern due to political conflicts. Along with his brothers and a retinue, Rurik accepted. Historians believe that Rurik either came from the Scandinavian peninsula or from Jutland. Another theory is that he and his army were mercenaries. </h6>
