    <h6 class="float1"> According to Britannica (n.d.), Kievan Rus’ was founded by the Viking Oleg. He was the ruler of Novgorod since 879, one of the oldest Russian cities located in the north. He captured Smolensk and Kiev in 882. Kiev became the capital due to its strategic location. Oleg united local Slavic and Finnish tribes and defeated the Khazars, a semi-nomadic Turkic tribe. He also arranged trade agreements with Constantinople. </h6>
    <h6 class="float2"> His successor was Igor of Kiev, who is considered to be a less capable ruler. He is regarded to be the founder of the Rurik dynasty, who were invited by the people of Novgorod to rule to establish peace and order. His treaty with Constantinople in 945 is considered to be less favorable than the 911 treaty. Igor was also the husband of Saint Olga of Kiev, who attacked the Drevlians after their murder of Igor. </h6>
    <h6 class="float3"> Vladimir the Great was the grandson of Igor. The beginning of the Golden Age of Rus’ was marked by his leadership. One of the most important events that happened during his rule was converting Rus’ to Orthodox Christian. This blossomed from a pact with the then Byzantine Emperor Basil II. Basil II promised Vladimir would marry his sister in exchange for military aid and conversion to Christianity. </h6>
