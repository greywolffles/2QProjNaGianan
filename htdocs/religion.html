    <h6 class="float1"> According to Britannica (n.d.), Christianity was present in Kyiv even before Vladimir was born. He was a pagan for most of his life, but when Byzantine Emperor Basil II needed military aid, he exchanged this for his sister Anne's marriage to Vladimir the Great. Vladimir also had to convert to Christianity, and this pact was accepted. </h6>
    <h6 class="float2"> The Christian worship of Rus' adopted the Byzantine rite. Vladimir was also choosing between German Christendom, Islam, and Judaism, but chose Rus' due to its transcendent beauty that he felt represented his determination. The Byzantines had ecclesiastical control over the church of Rus' and appointed a Greek metropolitan. </h6>
    <h6 class="float3"> Another influential figure was Saint Olga of Kyiv, the wife of Igor of Kyiv. She is considered a saint due to her major positive religious and political influence over the provinces of Rus'. She started the movement for Rus' to convert into Christianity through an alliance with Constantinople. </h6>
